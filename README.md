# BudgetCLI

A command-line interface (CLI) application for budget management.

---
## 📝 Overview

BudgetCLI is a tool designed to help users manage their budgets directly from the terminal. It uses SQLite for data storage and Goose for database migrations.

---
## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Go**: v1.25 or higher
- **SQLite**: Ensure you have SQLite installed if you want to inspect the database manually.
- **Goose**: Used for database migrations.

---
## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd budgetcli
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (refer to [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

4. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   # Using goose (ensure goose is installed)
   goose -dir database/migrations sqlite3 database/app.db up
   ```

---
## 🖥️ Run Commands

To run the application:

```bash
go run app/cli/main.go
```

To build the application:

```bash
go build -o budgetcli app/cli/main.go
./budgetcli
```

---
## 📔 Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `scripts/` directory:

- **Manage Test Data**: Use `scripts/manage_test_data.sh` to populate or clear the database with test data.
  - Populate: `./scripts/manage_test_data.sh up`
  - Clear: `./scripts/manage_test_data.sh down`

Standard Go CLI commands:

- **Build**: `go build -o budgetcli app/cli/main.go`
- **Run**: `go run app/cli/main.go`
- **Migrate Up**: `goose -dir database/migrations sqlite3 database/app.db up`

## 🏡 Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables (typically stored in a `.env` file):

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `GOOSE_DRIVER` | Database driver for Goose | `sqlite3` |
| `GOOSE_DBSTRING` | Path to the SQLite database file | `database/app.db` |
| `GOOSE_MIGRATION_DIR` | Path to the migrations directory | `database/migrations` |

---
## 🪧 Tests

Automated Go tests are currently being implemented. In the meantime, you can use the test data script to verify database operations.

To run Go tests (when added):
```bash
go test ./...
```

To populate test data:
```bash
./scripts/manage_test_data.sh up
```
